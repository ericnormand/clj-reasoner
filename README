# clj-reasoner

A simple graph reasoner writtern in Clojure.

Nodes in the graph are strings.
Edges are labeled with strings.

A query is a graph pattern.  When applied to a graph, it returns the subgraphs that matches the pattern.

Warning: This is something I did in a weekend.  It needs to be cleaned up.
